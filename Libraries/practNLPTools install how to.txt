This tool is a dependency parser. May need to compare and contrast it's effectiveness vs. the Stanford Parser

https://github.com/biplab-iitb/practNLPTools

How to install:
First download the .zip of the repository
After doing that, unzip the repository
Inside you will find a python file called setup.py

If you are in linux: run:
sudo python setup.py install 

If you are in windows: run this commands as administrator:
python setup.py install



How to use the library:
First import the tools into the respective python module
	from practnlptools.tools import Annotator

Then, create a new Annotator object
	annotator=Annotator()

Finally, to actually do the parse call
	parse = annotator.getAnnotations("Here is the text I will parse")

You can then get various information from the parse data structure. For example
	parse['verbs']
	>>>[A list of all of the verbs inside the text]

	notes['syntax_tree']
	>>>A representation of the syntax tree of the text.
