This tool generates parse trees.

How to get it working:

1. download the stanford-parser from  http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml
and unzip the file. [let's say the path of the extracted folder is <parser-path> on your system.]
	-Make sure that you download version 3.5.2

2. To get the stanford parser working from the command line do the following
	Extract the following file from the stanford-parser-3.5.2-models jar file
		stanford-parser-3.5.2-models.jar\edu\stanford\nlp\models\lexparser\englishPCFG.ser

3. By setting inputFileLocation, outputFileLocation, and the parser location correctly, you should be able to run and
see output from the following code

inputFileLocation = "1.txt"
outputFileLocation = "results.txt"
parserLocation = "../Libraries/stanford-parser"
command = "java -classpath %s/stanford-parser.jar -mx512m edu.stanford.nlp.parser.lexparser.LexicalizedParser %s/" \
           "stanford-parser-3.5.2-models/englishPCFG.ser.gz %s >> %s" % (parserLocation, parserLocation, inputFileLocation, outputFileLocation)

subprocess.call(command, shell=True)


Essentially, you need to make sure that the .jar location and the location of the englishPCFG are correct
