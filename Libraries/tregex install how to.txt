Download version 3.5.2 of tregex from this link:
	http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tregex.shtml#Download

One downloaded, verify that you are able to search for tregex patterns by following these steps.

	Unzip the downloaded folder
	Inside that folder, double click on stanford-tregex-3.5.2
	In the resulting GUI, click tools -> options and check off Enable Tsurgeon
	Load a tree into the program by doing File -> Load Trees and then select the file atree inside the examples folder
	Type in corresponding patterns and tsurgeon scripts and verify the results. Here are some sample inputs

		Pattern: NP < (NP=np < NNS) < (NP=np1 < NN)
		Tsurgeon Script: relabel np S

	The pattern search result should be that you matched the sentence "Try this wine and these snals ."
	The Tsurgeon result should be the tree with the rightmost NP replaced with a S.

NOTE: if you are working on windows, you might find that you get an error like

	"Error: Could not find or load main class edu.stanford.nlp.trees.tregex.tusrgeon.Tsurgeon"

To fix this, change the code in tregex.sh and tsurgeon.sh to the following:


For tregex:
#!/bin/sh
scriptdir=`dirname $0`

java -mx100m -cp $scriptdir/stanford-tregex.jar edu.stanford.nlp.trees.tregex.TregexPattern "$@"


For tsurgeon:
#!/bin/sh

java -mx100m -cp stanford-tregex.jar edu.stanford.nlp.trees.tregex.tsurgeon.Tsurgeon "$@"
